## dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They work reasonably well on CentOS 6/7, Fedora 20/21, and OS X 10.9/10.

You will want to at least install vcprompt (the C one, not the python one) and zsh to take advantage of them.

They also assume the use of vim with plugins installed throught Vundle, and vim will complain without ctags.
